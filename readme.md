# Laravel 101 Sample Code

This is the complementary code to my [Laravel 101 presentation](https://github.com/cviebrock/laravel-101-slides).

The code is pretty self-explanatory, and is organized by tags.  So checking out the `master` branch will actually give you the complete code, but checking tag `v1.0`, then `v2.0`, etc., will take you through things as I demoed them.

There is some stuff in here that I didn't show at the presentation (i.e. database seeding, the sample Book CRUD system, etc.), so explore.

And apologies in advance for my unhelpful commit messages.  The tags are named nicely, however, so try a `git tag -n` after you clone the repo.

Enjoy!
